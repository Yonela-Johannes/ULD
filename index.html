                <h4>Ulwazi Background</h4>
                <p>Ulwazi was created by the amazing <b>Lumka Johannes, a pure inspiration.  Ulwazi means ‘Knowledge’ in Xhosa.</b><br>
                Lumka grew up in the Townships(poor communities), in Cape Town where she thought Universities were a place for people with money. After Secondary school she started out her life as a cleaner which meant long commutes and long hours of work but not much income.  After a while she was transferred to the University of Cape Town by her cleaning company.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In poor South African communities, parents need to work long hours to put food on their table, often working in poorly paid jobs – leaving home early and coming back very late with public transport.
                <br>
                <br><b>Typically these poor families have no money for after care, which means the kids are left on the streets to mix with the wrong crowd as young as 3and 4.</b><br>
                This is where young people start getting into drugs and alcohol and even worse crime. 
                They are easy prey for gangs.

                <b>"This is why Ulwazi is so important, but I’m skipping ahead.</b>

                When Lumka started her dream as an after care centre in <u>June 2018.</u>.In October 2018 she took leave from her receptionist job and opened up her home for kids from her neighbourhood. What started out as 10 children amounted up to 34 children and they were all begging her not go to work and stay with them." We can already see how this will help in her neighbourhood and proved to be something which is so needed in South Africa during this time. 
                Through the skills she teach women on how to start a business. With 2 women Lumka met in her neighbouring communities, with a similar vision, and they too want to set up the same facilities in their communities.  This concept is there fore bigger than just one person. The vision of these women has potential to create real significant impact in the communities if they had all the resources to make this a reality. 
                This is the power of dreaming and love.

            <div class="wrapp">

                <img class="display-img" src="images/lush.jpg" alt="woman standing">
                <h4>Challenges faced by Ulwazi</h4>
                <p>Lumka is currently studying in her spare time to be a teacher – which is her long term passion. In the meantime Lumka has not been able to do any of the after care she did in October 2018 as she had no more leave, as she needed to use her leave days for her teaching studies practicals. Now given the demands of her position she is not even able to have time out to continue her studies for her passion.
                    So what’s stopping Ulwazi from taking shape?
                    As with many things financial resources. Lumka has her own family she needs to take care of, she needs her job so is in no position to quit her job and run Ulwazi full time. She is still studying and her leave days are limited. What would be amazing would be if we could raise enough money for Lumka to quit her job and run Ulwazi full time. This resource centre has the potential to make a huge difference in the lives of kids in Cape Town. The community in Mfuleni has shown that they are really need this facility offered by Ulwazi.
                    What Lumka is creating, which all started as a dream, is a future for kids and even more a future free of crime and drugs and poverty. This is helping at the grass roots level where it all starts, how amazing is that.
                    The challenge is that this After Care Facility requires resources to be fully functional and play its role in the community. The kids’ parents can’t afford to pay anyone to look after their kids so it needs to be free but where do the resources come from? – that’s where your support comes in.
                    In addition, how can Lumka afford to do this without an income? That’s also where this crowd funding comes in.

            <div class="wrapp">
                <h4>What we are currently doing </h4>
                <p>As a contribution towards Ulazwi, Towards Health is pledging to donate 10% of any profits each month to this worthy cause. Towards Health is an organisation that does ABCD….XYZ
                Also, Lumka is giving up every minute of her free time towards buildingUlwazi, but she is unable to do much with the demands of her current job.She has been unable to get any leave due to the pressure of work, and on atypical day she leaves very early in the morning and only gets home in theearly evening.                    
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapp">
                <h4>Expected impacts</h4>
                <p>Ulwazi is not only going to provide after care services to poor families in Mfuleni, but deal with some deep community challenges that are proving to be very difficult to address. By providing an educational environment where kids can be supervised to develop a culture of reading, but also develop various practical skills, Ulwazi will keep kids off the streets and away from bad influence. Just imagine if Ulwazi became fully operational, what would the world look like with fewer gangs, fewer people on drugs, less crime, more educated poor people creating a living for themselves rather than relying on government handhout.  The more money we raise the bigger the reach of this beautiful concept.

                            Most of the time parents are almost never at home to watch after their children. Their life situation does not allow them to be.
                            Livelihood forces parents to leave children as infants at home then children end up idolising and taking role models
                            from the streets. Parents do not have the needed to time spend with their children and to motivate them enough.
